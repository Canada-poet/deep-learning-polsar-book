abstract={Recently, neural networks have been increasingly applied to remote sensing imagery classification. The conventional neural network classifier performs learning from the representative information within a problem domain on a one-pixel-one-class basis; therefore, class mixture and the degree of membership of a pixel are generally not taken into account, often resulting in a poor classification accuracy. Based on the framework of a dynamic learning neural network (DL), this communications proposes a fuzzy version (FDL) based on two steps: network representation of fuzzy logic and assignment of membership. Comparisons between the DL and FDL are made by applying both neural networks to SAR image classification. Experimental results show that the FDL has faster convergence rate than that of DL. In addition, the separability between similar classes is improved. Moreover, the classification results match better with ground truth},

pages={2338-2353}, 
abstract={In this paper, we derive two techniques for the classification of multifrequency/multitemporal polarimetric SAR images, based respectively on a statistical and on a neural approach. Both techniques are especially designed to exploit the spatial structure of the observed scene, thus allowing more stable classification results. Such techniques are useful when looking at medium- to large-scale features, like the boundaries between urban and nonurban areas. They are applied to a set of SIR-C images of a urban area, to test their effectiveness in the identification of the different classes that compose the observed scene. A lower and an upper bound to the classification performance are introduced to characterize their limits. They correspond respectively to pixel-by-pixel classification and to the joint classification of the pixels belonging to the different classes identified in the ground truth. The results achieved with the two approaches are quantitatively analyzed by comparing them to the ground truth. Moreover, a hybrid approach is presented, where the homogeneous regions identified through statistical segmentation are classified using a neurofuzzy technique. Finally, a quantitative analysis of the results achieved with all the proposed techniques is carried out, showing that their classification performance is much higher than the lower bound and reasonably close to the upper bound. This is a consequence of their effectiveness in the exploitation of the spatial information.},

year={2014}, 
volume={7}, 
number={4}, 
pages={1394-1401}, 
abstract={Land cover classification is one of the most important applications of polarimetric SAR images, especially in urban areas. There are numerous features that can be extracted from these images, hence feature selection plays an important role in PolSAR image classification. In this study, three main steps are used to address this task: (1) feature extraction in the form of three categories, namely original data features, decomposition features, and SAR discriminators; (2) feature selection in the framework of the single and multi-objective optimization; and (3) image classification using the best subset of features. In single objective methods, we employ genetic algorithms (GAs) and support vector machines (SVMs) or multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network in order to maximize classification accuracy. Then a new method is proposed to perform an efficient land cover classification of the San Francisco Bay urban area based on the multi-objective optimization approach. The objectives are to minimize the error of classification and the number of selected PolSAR parameters. The experimental results on Radarsat-2 fine-quad data show that the proposed method outperforms the single objective approaches tested against it, while saving computational complexity. Finally, we show that the our method has a better performance than the SVM with full set of features and the Wishart classifier which is based on the covariance matrix.},

abstract={This study contributes an assessment of the potential of single-polarization decametric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in classifying land cover within and around large urban areas and in monitoring their changes. The decision task is performed on a pixel basis and is carried out by supervised neural network algorithms fed by radar image features including backscattering intensity, coherence and textural parameters. Two configurations are considered: a short-term classification and change detection scheme intended for providing information in near-real time and a long-term scheme aimed at observing the urban changes at year time scales. We use a pair of interferometric images for the short-term case, while the long-term exercise utilizes two interferometric pairs and a fifth single acquisition. The images are acquired by the ERS SAR in late winter, spring and early summer over 836 square kilometers including Rome, Italy, and its surroundings. The accuracy of the short-term algorithm in discriminating seven types of surface is higher than 86%, while the accuracy of the long-term algorithm is beyond 88%. The many changes undergone by Rome from 1994 to 1999 have been identified by the postclassification comparison change detection procedure. The pixel-by-pixel analysis of the results has been carried out for a 160 square kilometers test area, obtaining a correct detection above 82% (less than 18% missed alarms and 0.3% false alarms).},

    abstract = { In this paper a suitable neural classification algorithm, based on the use of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks, is applied to the fusion and classification of optical and SAR urban images. ART networks provide a flexible tool for classification, but are ruled by a large number of parameters. Therefore, the simplified ART2-A algorithm is used in this paper, and the neural approach is integrated into a classification chain where fuzzy clustering for merging of classes is also considered. The interaction between the two methods leads to encouraging results in less CPU time than classification with fuzzy clustering alone or other classical approaches (ISODATA). Examples of classification are provided using C-band total power AIRSAR data and optical images of Santa Monica, Los Angeles. }

abstract={In this paper, we proposed a new strategy for urban land cover classification by fusing high spatial resolution optical images and polarimetric SAR images. The novelty of strategy was in twofold: introduce an object-based classification method to alleviate the negative impact of inner class variability of high spatial resolution images in urban areas and geometric differences between the SAR and optical image; construct a fuzzy model to fuse features with different properties and ranges. Experiments were carried out to validate the strategy by using eCognition8.0. 1m RGB airborne images and 4m quad-polarization RADARSAT-2 images in Zhangye City, Gansu Province were used. Both of the images were acquired in July 2012. Results indicated that the optical image shows good performance at extracting land covers with distint spectral features such as natural vegetation, while the SAR image is better at differentiating several other land covers with similar spectral identities. For example, the introduction of polarimetric SAR features clearly improve the classification accuracy of bare soil and buildings by about 5%-10%, and also help the separation of artificial and natural vegetation to some extent. The overall classification accuracy increases from 85% to 88.18%. Based on object-based classification and fuzzy deduction, the proposed strategy proves a promising tool in fusing SAR and optical images to extract urban land cover.},

abstract={The classification of urban areas in terms of land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps is a challenging as well as essential task in order to monitor how the urban sprawl is changing the environment. This paper is devoted to the description of a novel procedure designed to exploit coarse-resolution SAR images and obtain both the built-up area extents and a LULC map of the individuated urban area. The approach starts from the previously developed BuiltArea algorithm to produce the built-up area extent map, exploiting the spatial correlation among neighboring pixels by means of local indicators of spatial association and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. After discriminating between urban and nonurban areas, a novel approach is presented that exploits segmentation techniques, spatial feature selection, and a supervised classifier to generate urban LULC maps. A robust chain, considering SAR data and using ancillary optical data is proposed and validated using data sets available in two test cases, the megacities of Shanghai and Beijing.},
