Whereas, in military radar utilization of complete$\backslash$npolarization scattering matrix radars is not yet fully accepted, in$\backslash$nremote sensing on the other hand, radar polarimetry seems to have been$\backslash$naccepted as an indispensable tool, and convincing results have been$\backslash$nobtained for geo-environmental applications in agriculture, forestry,$\backslash$nhydrology, flood plain and rural infrastructure maintenance, volcanology$\backslash$nand seismology, archeology, etc. However, there still exists a large$\backslash$nvoid in standardization and proper handling of basic and applied$\backslash$npolarimetric theory and concepts. In this paper a succinct assessment of$\backslash$nthe current state-of-the-art is presented summarizing the basic$\backslash$npolarimetry concepts spelled out in Boerner et al. (1997).

The method relies on an eigenvalue analysis of the coherency matrix and employs a three-level Bernoulli statistical model to generate estimates of the average target scattering matrix parameters from the data. The scattering entropy is a key parameter is determining the randomness in this model and is seen as a fundamental parameter in assessing the importance of polarimetry in remote sensing problems. The authors show application of the method to some important classical random media scattering problems and apply it to POLSAR data from the NASA/JPL AIRSAR data base},

We try to improve the pixel-by-pixel classification of an urban area by considering texture measures as a means for block analysis and classification. We find some interesting hints concerning the optimal dimension of the window to be considered for texture measures, as well as the most useful measures. Moreover, we show that it is possible to use medium-resolution readily available satellite synthetic aperture radar images for a more refined urban analysis than previously shown.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduces a new classification scheme for dual frequency polarimetric SAR data sets. A (6×6) polarimetric coherency matrix is defined to simultaneously take into account the full polarimetric information from both images. This matrix is composed of the two coherency matrices and their cross-correlation. A decomposition theorem is applied to both images to obtain 64 initial clusters based on their scattering characteristics. The data sets are then classified by an iterative algorithm based on a complex Wishart density function of the 6×6 matrix. A class number reduction technique is then applied on the 64 resulting clusters to improve the efficiency of the interpretation and representation of each class. An alternative technique is also proposed which introduces the polarimetric cross-correlation information to refine the results of classification to a small number of clusters using the conditional probability of the cross-correlation matrix. These classification schemes are applied to full polarimetric P, L, and C-band SAR images of the Nezer Forest, France, acquired by the NASA/JPL AIRSAR sensor in 1989},

The authors begin with the case in which scattering-matrix data are jointly Gaussian-distributed. The resulting copolar-phase PDF is formally identical to the phase PDF arising in the study of SAR interferometry, so the authors' results also apply in that setting. By direct simulation, they verify the closed-form PDF's. They show that estimation of signatures from averaged covariance matrices results in smaller biases and variances than averaging single-look signature estimates. They then generalize their derivation to certain cases in which backscattered intensities and amplitudes are K-distributed. They find in a range of circumstances that the PDF's of polarimetric signatures are unchanged from those derived in the Gaussian case. They verify this by direct simulation, and also examine a case that fails to satisfy an important assumption in their derivation. The forms of the signature distributions continue to describe data well in the latter case, but parameters in distributions fitted to (simulated) data differ from those used to generate the data. Finally, the authors examine samples of K-distributed polarimetric SAR data from Arctic sea ice and find that their theoretical distributions describe the data well with a plausible choice of parameters. This allows the authors to estimate the precision of polarimetric-signature estimates as a function of the number of SAR looks and other system parameters},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised terrain and land-use classification algorithm using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data. Unlike other algorithms that classify pixels statistically and ignore their scattering characteristics, this algorithm not only uses a statistical classifier, but also preserves the purity of dominant polarimetric scattering properties. This algorithm uses a combination of a scattering model-based decomposition developed by Freeman and Durden and the maximum-likelihood classifier based on the complex Wishart distribution. The first step is to apply the Freeman and Durden decomposition to divide pixels into three scattering categories: surface scattering, volume scattering, and double-bounce scattering. To preserve the purity of scattering characteristics, pixels in a scattering category are restricted to be classified with other pixels in the same scattering category. An efficient and effective class initialization scheme is also devised to initially merge clusters from many small clusters in each scattering category by applying a merge criterion developed based on the Wishart distance measure. Then, the iterative Wishart classifier is applied. The stability in convergence is much superior to that of the previous algorithm using the entropy/anisotropy/Wishart classifier. Finally, an automated color rendering scheme is proposed, based on the classes' scattering category to code the pixels to resemble their natural color. This algorithm is also flexible and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's AIRSAR and the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) E-SAR L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a classification method suitable for high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images over urban areas. When processing SAR images, there is a strong need for statistical models of scattering to take into account multiplicative noise and high dynamics. For instance, the classification process needs to be based on the use of statistics. Our main contribution is the choice of an accurate model for high-resolution SAR images over urban areas and its use in a Markovian classification algorithm. Clutter in SAR images becomes non-Gaussian when the resolution is high or when the area is man-made. Many models have been proposed to fit with non-Gaussian scattering statistics (K, Weibull, Log-normal, Nakagami-Rice, etc.), but none of them is flexible enough to model all kinds of surfaces in our context. As a consequence, we use a mathematical model that relies on the Fisher distribution and the log-moment estimation and which is relevant for one-look data. This estimation method is based on the second-kind statistics, which are detailed in the paper. We also prove its accuracy for urban areas at high resolution. The quality of the classification that is obtained by mixing this model and a Markovian segmentation is high and enables us to distinguish between ground, buildings, and vegetation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cameron's coherent target decomposition (CTD) theory and the classification method that Cameron developed for operational use of his CTD are reconsidered. It is shown that Cameron's classification leads to a coarse scattering segmentation because of the large class dispersion that corresponds to a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system with about ±8-dB channel imbalance. The application of Cameron's method within known SAR radiometric calibration requirements limits the utility of the classification. In addition, Cameron's classification is applied under the implicit assumption on the coherence nature of target scattering, and this might yield erroneous results within areas of noncoherent scattering. A new method, named the symmetric scattering characterization method (SSCM), is introduced to better exploit the information provided by the largest target symmetric scattering component in the context of coherent scattering. The Poincare´ sphere is used as the basis for a more complete representation of symmetric scattering than Cameron's unit disk, thus enabling the SSCM to generate better segmentation of target symmetric scattering with much higher resolution. In order to limit the application of the SSCM to targets of coherent scattering, new methods are developed for assessment and validation of the coherent nature of point and extended target scattering.},
