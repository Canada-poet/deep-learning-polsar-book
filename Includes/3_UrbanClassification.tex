\chapter{Supervised Urban Classification}

In this chapter, a novel methodology for classification of urban built-up areas in PolSAR images is highlighted (Section~\ref{sec:method_delta741}). Further, experiments are conducted to test and validate the proposed methodology (Section~\ref{sec:expt_cathay312}). Finally, the results of the experiments are discussed (Section~\ref{ref:results1}).
