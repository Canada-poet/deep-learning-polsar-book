\chapter{Semi-supervised Change Detection}

In this chapter, a novel methodology for semi-supervised classification of changes in urban built-up areas in PolSAR images is proposed (Section~\ref{sec:sfo_ba145}). Further, experiments are conducted to test and validate this methodology (Section~\ref{sec:exp}). Finally, the results of the experiments are discussed (Section~\ref{sec:resultsA1}).
