\chapter{Snow-Cover Mapping}
In this chapter, a novel snow cover mapping framework is proposed which uses the Poincar\'e sphere parameters obtained from the Radarsat-2 full-polarimetric SAR images in PolSAR images, for which the methodology is highlighted (Section~\ref{sec:airindia_515}). Further, experiments are conducted to test and validate the proposed methodology (Section~\ref{sec:airindia_15}). Finally, the results of the experiments are discussed (Section~\ref{sec:airindia_5}).
