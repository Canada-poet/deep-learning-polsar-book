\chapter{Multi-frequency Crop Classification}

In this chapter, a novel tensor product and neural network based framework for classification of vegetative areas like agricultural fields and forests is presented (Section~\ref{sec:sfo_ba33}). Further, experiments are conducted to test and validate the proposed methodology (Section~\ref{sec:delta_911}). Finally, the results of the experiments are discussed (Section~\ref{sec:jameson}).
